## Overview

A skeleton is used as a placeholder for content that is yet to be retrieved/loaded/rendered. It helps the user to see what's coming, but isn't there yet. A skeleton impersonates the content that will be there soon, and lets the user know what is happening.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="All variants">
        <div style={{ margin: '8px 0' }}>
            <Skeleton />
        </div>
        <div style={{ margin: '8px 0' }}>
            <Skeleton
                isFullWidth
            />
        </div>
        <div style={{ margin: '8px 0', width: '150px', height: '150px' }}>
            <Skeleton
                variant="figure"
            />
        </div>
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### When to use this component

Use skeletons as placeholders for content that is loading, and of which the user can expect that it is coming soon. If the content takes more time than, say, 4 seconds, provide the user with extra information of what is happening and why it is taking so long.

### When to not use this component

Do not use skeletons for content that takes a long time to load (e.g. more than 4 seconds). This might lead to the user thinking something is broken.

## Component API

<Props />

### `id`

You can optionally set the skeleton's ID by providing the optional `id` prop.

```jsx
<Skeleton id="myDialog" />
```

### `className`

You can optionally set a custom (CSS) classname for the skeleton by providing the optional `className` prop.

```jsx
<Skeleton className="my-dialog" />
```

### `isFullWidth`

Provide the `isFullWidth` prop as `true` in order to let the skeleton occupy all the available horizontal space.

<Skeleton isFullWidth />

```jsx
<Skeleton isFullWidth />
```

### `isFullHeight`

Provide the `isfullHeight` prop as `true` in order to let the skeleton occupy all the available vertical space. In the example below, the skeleton is rendered within a `<div />` container element that is 50 pixels high.

<div style={{  height: '50px' }}>
    <Skeleton isFullHeight />
</div>

```jsx
<Skeleton isFullHeight />
```

## Skeleton variants

Skeletons are rendered in their 'text' variant by default, so you can use them as a placeholder for loading text based content.

### Figure skeletons

Use figure skeletons as placeholders for loading figure elements, such as images.

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Figure"
        args={{
            variant: 'figure'
        }}
    >
        {(args) => (
            <div style={{ margin: '8px 0', width: '150px', height: '150px' }}>
                <Skeleton {...args} />
            </div>
        )}
    </Story>
</Canvas>
