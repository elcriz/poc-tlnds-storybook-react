## Overview

A section card is used to feature sections of the service or product website or app. They are typically used inside `Collection` components, in which they are grouped together with other section cards.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="All section cards">
        <Collection variant="oneHalf">
            <SectionCard
                heading="Some featured section"
                description="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
            />
            <SectionCard
                heading="Some featured section with image"
                description="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
                imageUrl={exampleImageFile}
            />
        </Collection>
    </Story>
</Canvas>
