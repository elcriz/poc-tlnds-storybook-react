## Overview

An app card is used to feature specific content, typically an app. They are typically used inside `Collection` components, in which they are grouped together with related apps.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="All variants">
        <Collection variant="oneHalf">
            <AppCard
                heading="An app without icon"
                information="Some app publisher"
                ratingValue={3}
            />
            <AppCard
                heading="An app with an icon"
                information="Some app publisher"
                iconImageUrl={exampleImageFile}
                ratingValue={3}
            />
        </Collection>
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### When to use this component

Use app cards to feature content like apps and/or external tools. Typically, this is done in an overview of featured apps (e.g. under "Newest apps" or "App search results"). See the `PageSection` component for examples.

### When to not use this component

Only use app cards to feature content like apps, external tools etc. Do not use app cards for content like news or blog articles, products etc. Also see [Related components](#related-components).

## Component API

<Props />

### `id`

You can optionally set the app card's ID by providing the optional `id` prop.

```jsx
<AppCard
    id="myAppCard"
    heading="App card with custom ID"
/>
```

### `className`

You can optionally set a custom (CSS) classname for the app card by providing the optional `className` prop.

```jsx
<AppCard
    className="my-app-card"
    heading="App card with custom classname"
/>
```

### `heading`

You must set the featured app or external tool's heading by providing the `heading` prop accordingly.

```jsx
<AppCard
    heading="Some educational app"
/>
```

### `information`

You can optionally set the featured app or external tool's information (other than its title) by providing the `information` prop.

```jsx
<AppCard
    heading="Some educational app"
    information="Some educational app publisher"
/>
```

### `url`

You may set an url for the app card to point to when the user clicks or taps it.

```jsx
<AppCard
    heading="Some educational app"
    url="https://some.educational.app.com/"
/>
```

### `ratingValue`

You can optionally set the featured app or external tool's rating value (typically coming from user reviews and/or ratings) by providing the `ratingValue` prop accordingly. If left `undefined`, no rating will be shown. A rating value of `0` will be treated as if rated as 0. The maximum rating value is `5`. Use whole numbers (0-5).

<AppCard
    heading="Some educational app with user rating"
    ratingValue={3}
/>

```jsx
<AppCard
    heading="Some educational app with user rating"
    ratingValue={3}
/>
```

## App icons

You can optionally set the featured app or external tool's icon image url by providing the `iconImageUrl` prop. Relative paths can be used as well as direct paths/urls.

### Without app icon

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Without icon"
        args={{
            heading: 'Some educational app',
            information: 'Some educational app publisher',
            ratingValue: 3,
        }}
    >
        {(args) => (
            <AppCard {...args} />
        )}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### With app icon

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="With icon"
        args={{
            heading: 'Some educational app',
            information: 'Some educational app publisher',
            iconImageUrl: exampleImageFile,
            ratingValue: 3,
        }}
    >
        {(args) => (
            <AppCard {...args} />

    </Story>
