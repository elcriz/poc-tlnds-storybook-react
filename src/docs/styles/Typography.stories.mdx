# Font

The TLNDS uses the [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) font.

## Headings

Make up your headings semantically with the appropriate `<h#>` level HTML-element, and use a BEM heading class to apply the TLDS styling. Style headings consistently to create a clear visual hierarchy throughout your service.
