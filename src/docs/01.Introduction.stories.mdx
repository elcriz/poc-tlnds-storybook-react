# Welcome to the TLN Design System

Use this design system to make your service or product consistent with **The Learning Network (TLN)**. Learn from the research and experience of other service and product teams and avoid repeating work that's already been done. The goal is to make buidling durable UIs that meet TLN specs more productive and satisfying.

## Styles

Make your service look TLN compliant with guides for applying layout, typography, colour, images and more. Want to use our styles in your service or product? [See how to get started immediately](?path=/docs/get-started--page).

## Library

Save time with our library full of reusable, accessible React components for forms, navigation, buttons, cards and more. Individual components can be used in multiple different patterns and contexts. Want to use our components in your service or product? [See how to get started immediately](?path=/docs/get-started--page).

## Patterns

Patterns are TLN best practice design solutions for specific user-focused tasks and page or screen types. All of the patterns in this section are supported by written guidance and contain coded examples where possible and available.
Patterns often use one or more components and explain how to adapt them to the pattern's context.

## Contribute

The TLN Design System is for everyone, with a strong community sitting behind it. We welcome you to contribute as well. You can do this by:

- [proposing a new component or pattern](?path=/docs/how-to-contribute--page)
- [developing a component or pattern](?path=/docs/how-to-contribute--page)

*DISCLAIMER: This is a POC (proof of concept). It shows how Storybook could work for TLN in order to create a maintanable, durable design system, if implemented in React. The components provided are React components, based on the (Angular) code for the Learnspace "landing page" concept. They are by no means finished!*
