# Welcome to the TLN Design System

Use this design system to make your service consistent with **The Learning Network (TLN)**. Learn from the research and experience of other service and product teams and avoid repeating work that's already been done. The goal is to make buidling durable UIs that meet TLN specs more productive and satisfying.

## Contribute

The TLN Design System is for everyone, with a strong community sitting behind it. We welcome you to contribute as well. You can do this by:

- [proposing a new component or pattern](?path=/docs/how-to-contribute--page)
- [developing a component or pattern](?path=/docs/how-to-contribute--page)

*DISCLAIMER: This is a POC (proof of concept). It shows how Storybook could work for TLN in order to create a maintanable, durable design system, if implemented in React. The components provided are React components, based on the (Angular) code for the Learnspace "landing page" concept. They are by no means finished!*
