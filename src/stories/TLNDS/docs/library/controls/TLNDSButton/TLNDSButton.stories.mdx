# Button

Buttons allow users to take actions and make choices, with  a single click or tap.

`TLNDSButton` is the primary button component.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="All buttons" primary>
        <TLNDSButton label="Default" />
        <TLNDSButton label="Primary" variant="primary" />
        <TLNDSButton label="Secondary" variant="secondary" />
        <TLNDSButton label="Default outlined" isOutlined />
        <TLNDSButton label="Primary outlined" variant="primary" isOutlined />
        <TLNDSButton label="Secondary outlined" variant="secondary" isOutlined />
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## When to use this component

Use the `TLNDSButton` component to help users carry out an action, like confirming their purchase or saving their information.

## When to not use this component

Do not use this component to help navigate users to other pages or screens (e.g. 'Contact support' or 'Go back'). Use `TLNDSLink` components for that purpose instead.

## How it works

Write your `TLNDSButton` label text to describe the action the user or the system will carry out upon clicking or tapping it. For example:

- 'Log in' to an account the user has already created
- 'Add to my LML' to add a lesson material to the user's LML
- 'Confirm and send' on a page or screen that does not have any legal content the user must agree to
- 'Accept and send' on a page that has legal content the user must agree to
- 'Log out' or 'Sign out' when the user is signed in to their account

You may need to include more or different words to better describe the action. For example, 'Add another addess'.

Always align the primary action to the left edge of your form.

## Primary buttons

Primary buttons are used for default actions on a page or a screen. Avoid using multiple primary buttons on a single page or screen. Having more than one main call to an action reduces their impact, and makes it harder for the user to know what to do next.

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Primary"
        args={{
            label: 'Primary',
            variant: 'primary'
        }}
    >
        {(args) => (
            <TLNDSButton {...args} />
        )}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Secondary buttons

Secondary buttons are used for secondary actions on a page or a screen.
Primary buttons are used for default actions on a page or a screen. Avoid using multiple primary buttons on a single page or screen. Having more than one main call to an action reduces their impact, and makes it harder for the user to know what to do next.

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Secondary"
        args={{
            label: 'Secondary',
            variant: 'secondary'
        }}
    >
        {(args) => (
            <TLNDSButton {...args} />
        )}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Outlined buttons

Use outlined buttons when they are to have less emphasis than a contained button and/or are be rendered on a darker background.

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Outlined"
        args={{
            label: 'Outlined primary',
            variant: 'primary',
            isOutlined: true,
        }}
    >
        {(args) => (
            <TLNDSButton {...args} />
        )}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Disabled buttons

Use disabled buttons when they are not yet ready to be clicked or tapped on, but you want to help the user by already showing the possible action when a task is yet to be completed (e.g. when something is loading or not all mandatory fields in a form are filled out).

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Disabled"
        args={{
            label: 'Disabled primary',
            variant: 'primary',
            isDisabled: true,
        }}
    >
        {(args) => (
            <TLNDSButton {...args} />
        )}
    </Story>
</Canvas>
